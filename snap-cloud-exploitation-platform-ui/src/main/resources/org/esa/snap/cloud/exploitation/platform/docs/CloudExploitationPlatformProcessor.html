<p>
    The Cloud Exploitation Platform Processor is a multi-steps iterative process that executes on the remote machines a slave graph and then on the host machine it executes a master graph using the products created by the remote machines.
	
    The overall principle of the algorithm is to distribute processing and reduce the time when running a graph.	
</p>
<p>
    The two major steps are:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (i) execute products using a graph on the remote machines by means of the GPT application
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (ii) use the output products obtained in the previous step together with a another graph to create the final product.
</p>
<p>
    The products executed on the remote machines must be placed into a shared folder. Each remote machine must have installed the SSH server and the GPT application. When running a graph on a remote machine, the output product is placed in the same shared folder.
</p>


<h4>Remote topology dialog</h4>

<p>
    The remote topology dialog is placed in the Tools menu. It contains the properties used to access the shared folder and the remote machines for processing a graph.

<h4>Remote machine dialog</h4>

<p>
    The remote machine dialog contains the properties used to access a machine by means of the SSH protocol and process a slave graph using the GPT application installed on that machine. The dialog window can be accessed
	by means of the add/edit buttons from the remote topology dialog.
